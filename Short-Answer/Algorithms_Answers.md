#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n^3)
while loop runs on th order on n**3

b)
outer loop runs n times..O(n)
while loop  runs log n times...O(log n)

alltogether O(n log n)

c)

O(n)

for any bunnies n

## Exercise II


Proposed algorithm:


Start at the middle floor.
Drop an egg from this floor. If the egg breaks, eliminate all the floors above.
If the egg doesn't break, eliminate current floor and all the floors below.
Repeat the process with the uneliminated floors until there are only two floors left; f would be the higher of the two floors.
